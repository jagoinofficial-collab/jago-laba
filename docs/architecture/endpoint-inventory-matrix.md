# Endpoint inventory matrix Jago Laba

- Status: static read-only inventory completed for Prompt 2
- Snapshot: 2026-10-30
- Scope: legacy PHP public pages/API, Konveksi RPC, Marketplace AJAX, frontend
  callers, schema references, OAuth, worker, and cron
- Safety: no database write, migration, repair, provider call, or restore was
  executed while creating this inventory

## 1. Reading guide

This is a source-based inventory. `Tables` uses the table groups below so that
the endpoint rows stay reviewable while the full table names remain explicit.
An endpoint can read and write different tables in one request; the effect is
marked in the `Effect` column.

### Table groups

| Group | Tables and dynamic storage | Scope notes |
|---|---|---|
| `AUTH` | `auth_users_v2`, `system_users`, `system_settings`, `system_table_map`, `system_audit_logs`, `workspace_user_access`, `backup_log`, `migration_log`, `document_files`, `idempotency_keys`, native PHP session | User/session, workspace, audit, backup, and compatibility metadata. Company scope is established from session/user/config and must not be trusted from browser input. |
| `K-MAP` | `system_table_map` plus dynamic tables returned by `SnapshotImporter::tableName()`: `rekening`, `produk`, `bahan`, `bahan_hpp`, `hpp_model_bom`, `hpp_history`, `bahan_hpp_history`, `pegawai`, `supplier`, `pembelian`, `pembelian_item`, `potong`, `potong_item`, `jahit`, `jahit_item`, `keuangan`, `kasbon`, `profil`, `distribusi`, `pengguna`, `hak_akses`, `master_stok`, `mutasi_stok`, `pembelian_vendor`, `riwayat_bayar_hutang`, `hutang_konveksi`, `riwayat_bayar_hutang_konveksi`, `template_dokumen`, `penjualan`, `penjualan_item`, `penjualan_koreksi`, `material_alias`, `quality_control`, `mutasi_stok_konveksi`, `hutangsupplier`, `marketplace_product_mapping`, `marketplace_sync_queue` | The physical dynamic table name is resolved from `system_table_map`; inventory cannot claim a fixed table name when a sheet has not been imported. |
| `K-DOC` | `document_files`, private file path from `config/storage.php` | File ID and authorization must be checked before read/download. |
| `K-BACKUP` | `backup_log`, JSON snapshot, SQL dump path, private backup directories | Backup path and restore ability require host-specific verification. |
| `K-IDEMP` | `idempotency_keys`, `konveksi_request_receipts` | Marketplace expense and legacy Konveksi Inventory receipts use unique `(company_key,module,idempotency_key)` scope; remaining mutation paths require separate review. |
| `M-STORE` | `marketplace_stores`, `marketplace_oauth_connections`, `marketplace_oauth_states`, `marketplace_oauth_pending`, `marketplace_partner_settings`, `marketplace_api_credentials`, `marketplace_integration_bindings`, `marketplace_app_settings`, `marketplace_auto_sync`, `marketplace_auto_sync_runtime`, `marketplace_platform_cooldowns` | Store rows must be checked against `company_key`; OAuth connection rows must be checked against store and company. |
| `M-ORDER` | `marketplace_orders`, `marketplace_order_items`, `marketplace_orders_v3`, `marketplace_order_items_v3`, `marketplace_sync_records`, `marketplace_return_claims`, `marketplace_fulfillment_actions`, `marketplace_shipping_documents`, `marketplace_shipping_document_audit` | Order reads use store scope; financial and HPP values are contract data. |
| `M-FIN` | `marketplace_expenses`, `marketplace_product_ads`, `marketplace_ad_spends`, `marketplace_payout_reconciliations`, `marketplace_journal_entries`, `marketplace_withdrawals`, `marketplace_withdrawal_audit`, `marketplace_price_simulations` | Financial writes require audit and transaction semantics; import preview must not write final rows. |
| `M-CATALOG` | `marketplace_catalog_variants`, `marketplace_sku_mappings`, `marketplace_hpp_history`, `marketplace_hpp_changes`, `marketplace_price_actions`, `marketplace_stock_snapshots`, `marketplace_stock_minimums`, `marketplace_stock_minimum_audit` | Catalog and HPP are store-scoped; effective dates and nominal precision are contracts. |
| `M-SYNC` | `marketplace_sync_jobs`, `marketplace_sync_checkpoints`, `marketplace_sync_records`, `marketplace_sync_object_checks`, `marketplace_sync_workers` | Queue/checkpoint/lease state. A job must be bounded, idempotent, and recoverable after timeout. |
| `M-V3` | `marketplace_connected_stores`, `marketplace_oauth_attempts`, `marketplace_webhook_inbox`, `marketplace_listings_v3`, `marketplace_fulfillment_mappings_v3`, `marketplace_business_effects_v3`, `marketplace_financial_events_v3`, `marketplace_payout_order_links_v3` | Integration-review schema is present in legacy migrations but runtime ownership must be confirmed before use. |

### Status vocabulary

- `READ`: no intended database/provider write.
- `WRITE`: database, private file, queue, or provider side effect.
- `STUB`: source intentionally returns an unavailable response.
- `STATIC`: source evidence exists but runtime/database/provider test was not
  run.
- `PILOT`: Laravel implementation exists but does not replace the full legacy
  contract.

## 2. Public page and compatibility URL matrix

## 4. Konveksi RPC method matrix

All rows below are dispatched by `/api/rpc.php`. `prosesLoginBackend` is the
only method that is intentionally reachable without an existing session. Other
methods require a logged-in user, Konveksi workspace, company assertion, and
CSRF. Most writes additionally require an Owner/Admin role and pass through
`KonveksiOperationGate` for request receipts.

| RPC method | Caller / args and response | Auth, scope, CSRF | Tables | Effect | Test / risk | Laravel target |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `prosesLoginBackend` | Login form; username/password; auth result/session metadata | No prior session; password hash adapter | `AUTH` | `WRITE` session and login timestamp where available | [workspace_policy.php](../../tests/Integration/workspace_policy.php); hash source parity required | [AuthController.php](../../laravel-foundation/app/Http/Controllers/AuthController.php) |

## 5. Marketplace AJAX action matrix

All actions below share the legacy boundary checks in
[marketplace-ajax.php](../../app/Modules/Marketplace/Controllers/Api/marketplace-ajax.php):
Marketplace workspace and CSRF. The listed store-scoped actions additionally
require a non-empty `store_id` and server-side store access. Action-specific
role checks are shown where visible in the controller/service.

| Action | Method/input and response | Tables | Effect / external effect | Existing test / risk | Proposed Laravel target |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `save_hpp_batch` | POST; JSON `changes`; JSON count/message | `M-CATALOG`, `M-ORDER`, `AUTH` | `WRITE` HPP batch and recalculation | [marketplace_catalog_smoke.php](../../tests/Integration/marketplace_catalog_smoke.php); payload must carry unambiguous store scope | Form Request + HPP Action |

## 6. Frontend form and fetch inventory

The project contains duplicate asset trees under `public/assets/js/` and
`public/assets/marketplace/js/`. Marketplace pages currently reference the
second tree in several views, so both paths must be included in parity checks.

| Frontend caller | HTTP target and operations | Input/output contract | Scope and risk | Proposed Laravel target |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `public/assets/js/jl-api.js` and `public/assets/konveksi/js/jl-api.js` | `/api/rpc.php`; sends arbitrary RPC `method` and positional `args` | JSON RPC envelope, request ID, legacy error shape | RPC method/argument order is a hard compatibility contract | `LegacyRpcController` plus per-method Actions |
| `order-transaction-detail.js` (both asset trees) | `marketplace-ajax.php?action=get_order_detail`; TikTok refresh calls `marketplace-order-finance.php` POST | Order ID/store ID; presentation props include items, fees, HPP, returns, finance status | Must not disclose another store order; finance refresh can call provider | Laravel read pilot plus provider adapter |
| `marketplace-orders.js` (both asset trees) | `marketplace-orders.php` GET; `marketplace-fulfillment.php` POST `options|confirm`; `marketplace-shipping-document.php` POST then GET PDF | Filters, order/package IDs; HTML/JSON/PDF | Order PII and external fulfillment side effects | Separate Laravel read/fulfillment/document slices |
| `marketplace-dashboard.js` | `marketplace-dashboard.php` GET | Current query/date/store; HTML replacement | HTML fragment ID/props and financial totals are contract | Laravel read pilot |
| `marketplace-sync.js` | `marketplace-sync.php` POST `status` and starts through background helper | Store selector; JSON job rows/returns | Polling must not become long request; duplicate start prevention | Laravel sync controller/job |
| `marketplace-background-sync.js` | `marketplace-sync.php` POST `preview`, `background`, `status` | Selected stores and progress banner | Multi-store scope, checkpoint, overlap, worker availability | Laravel database queue pilot |
| `marketplace-catalog-sync.js` | `marketplace-sync.php` POST catalog action | Store; JSON catalog progress | Provider permissions and bounded catalog work | Laravel Job |
| `marketplace-integration-health.js` and `marketplace-sync.js` | `marketplace-integration-status.php` GET/POST retry and `marketplace-sync.php` status | Store, retry; JSON health | Retry may cause provider calls; rate limit and request ID | Laravel integration health |
| `marketplace-auto-sync.js` and `marketplace-auto-refresh.js` | `marketplace-auto-sync.php` POST setting, GET state | Store/mode/enabled; JSON states | Browser visibility/lifetime is not cron; avoid two schedulers | Scheduler plus browser fallback |
| `marketplace-browser-pulse.js` | `marketplace-browser-pulse.php` POST | CSRF only; JSON status | Must be one bounded step, not daemon emulation | Laravel manual/browser fallback |
| `marketplace-branding.js` and `marketplace-brand.php` | `marketplace-branding.php` POST save, GET image | Multipart logo and metadata; JSON/image | Company scope, MIME/size, private branding | Laravel settings slice |
| `marketplace-hpp-editor.js` | `marketplace-ajax.php` POST `save_hpp_batch` | JSON encoded changes; JSON result then reload | HPP/nominal and role scope | Laravel HPP Action |
| `marketplace-price.js` | `marketplace-price.php` POST `prepare|save` JSON | Store/product/payload/operation key; provider result | Unknown provider write outcome needs reconciliation | Laravel provider Action |
| `marketplace-settings-integration.js` | `marketplace-ajax.php` POST `restore_store`; `marketplace-partner-settings.php` POST; `marketplace-oauth.php` GET/POST OAuth actions; `logout.php` POST | Platform settings, OAuth state/pending, store ID, CSRF | Secret redaction, callback origin/state/replay, company scope | Laravel OAuth/settings adapters |
| `marketplace-stock.js` | `marketplace-stock.php` POST | Store/product/variant/warehouse/minimum; JSON | Admin only, precision and store scope | Laravel stock-minimum Action |
| `marketplace-withdrawals.js` | `marketplace-withdrawals.php` POST `preview|confirm` | Multipart file then session key; JSON | Upload PII, expiry, duplicate final import | Laravel import Action |
| `marketplace-store-deletion.js` | `marketplace-store-deletion.php` POST `list|preview|status|request|resume` | Store/action/confirmation; JSON progress | Destructive, worker, recovery and rollback | No cutover target |
| Marketplace PHP forms and links | `marketplace.php`, `api/marketplace-orders.php`, `api/marketplace-analytics.php`, `api/marketplace-dashboard.php`, withdrawals template | GET query: store, tab, filters, period/date, export format | Query/filter/redirect/HTML IDs must remain stable | Legacy facade until contract tests pass |
| Konveksi HTML controls | `index.php`, `workspace.php`, `api/rpc.php`, `api/logout.php`, `api/konveksi-document.php` | POST RPC/form args, CSRF, document ID | Dynamic collection and legacy session contract | Laravel adapter per RPC slice |

## 7. OAuth, worker, and cron inventory

| Surface | Current source | Trigger/input | Data/provider effect | Current test/evidence | Target and risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Legacy OAuth callback | [marketplace-oauth.php](../../app/Modules/Marketplace/Controllers/Api/marketplace-oauth.php) | Browser GET callback with state/code/error; POST settings actions | OAuth state, pending shops, encrypted connection, initial sync queue, provider calls | [marketplace_oauth_smoke.php](../../tests/Integration/marketplace_oauth_smoke.php) | Keep callback URL until Laravel/sandbox contract is registered; no Live call in this phase |
| Laravel OAuth sandbox | [MarketplaceOAuthController.php](../../laravel-foundation/app/Http/Controllers/MarketplaceOAuthController.php), [SandboxMarketplaceOAuthProvider.php](../../laravel-foundation/app/Marketplace/OAuth/SandboxMarketplaceOAuthProvider.php) | status/start/callback/pending/select/refresh | Sandbox only; tokens encrypted; no provider Live | [OAuthSandboxTest.php](../../laravel-foundation/tests/Feature/OAuthSandboxTest.php) | Pilot evidence only; production registration/permissions pending |
| Legacy cron CLI | [marketplace-cron.php](../../bin/workers/marketplace-cron.php) | CLI `--task`; Windows/PowerShell assumptions in legacy flow | Provider sync and writes | [marketplace_sync_smoke.php](../../tests/Integration/marketplace_sync_smoke.php) | Not shared-hosting compatible; do not expose from generic AJAX |
| Legacy background worker | [marketplace-background-worker.php](../../bin/workers/marketplace-background-worker.php) | CLI/background launch | Long-running/bounded sync depending on mode | Static only | Replace by Laravel database queue; no daemon in target |
| Legacy auto-sync worker | [marketplace-auto-sync.php](../../bin/workers/marketplace-auto-sync.php) | CLI store/task | Sync and state | Static only | Browser/cron overlap risk |
| Legacy deletion worker | [marketplace-store-deletion.php](../../bin/workers/marketplace-store-deletion.php) | CLI store ID | Destructive store cleanup | [marketplace_store_deletion_test.php](../../tests/Integration/marketplace_store_deletion_test.php) | Keep isolated until deletion/restore review |
| Laravel queue job | [MarketplaceSyncJob.php](../../laravel-foundation/app/Pilots/Marketplace/MarketplaceSyncJob.php) | Database `jobs` row; company/store/run key | Bounded checkpoint sync | [MarketplaceQueueTest.php](../../laravel-foundation/tests/Feature/MarketplaceQueueTest.php) | Orphaned domain-row-after-dispatch risk remains |
| Laravel scheduler | [console.php](../../laravel-foundation/routes/console.php) | `schedule:run`, every five minutes, `withoutOverlapping` | Dispatches bounded sync | [MarketplaceQueueTest.php](../../laravel-foundation/tests/Feature/MarketplaceQueueTest.php) | Host cron and single-scheduler proof pending |

## 8. Existing test and evidence map

| Concern | Legacy evidence | Laravel evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Auth/session/workspace | [workspace_policy.php](../../tests/Integration/workspace_policy.php) | [AuthScopeTest.php](../../laravel-foundation/tests/Feature/AuthScopeTest.php) | Synthetic auth/scope coverage passes; live multi-user permission matrix not measured |
| Marketplace read and orders | [marketplace_dashboard_smoke.php](../../tests/Integration/marketplace_dashboard_smoke.php), [marketplace_orders_smoke.php](../../tests/Integration/marketplace_orders_smoke.php) | [PilotReadOnlyTest.php](../../laravel-foundation/tests/Feature/PilotReadOnlyTest.php) | Same-fixture legacy-vs-Laravel dashboard parity passes; dashboard smoke also passes against a temporary database, not production |
| OAuth | [marketplace_oauth_smoke.php](../../tests/Integration/marketplace_oauth_smoke.php), [marketplace_oauth_origin_smoke.php](../../tests/Integration/marketplace_oauth_origin_smoke.php) | [OAuthSandboxTest.php](../../laravel-foundation/tests/Feature/OAuthSandboxTest.php) | Sandbox coverage passes; provider Live/callback registration not tested |
| Queue/sync | [marketplace_sync_smoke.php](../../tests/Integration/marketplace_sync_smoke.php) | [MarketplaceQueueTest.php](../../laravel-foundation/tests/Feature/MarketplaceQueueTest.php) | Bounded synthetic tests pass; real cron overlap/restart and dispatch-loss recovery remain open |
| Financial/HPP | [marketplace_finance_smoke.php](../../tests/Integration/marketplace_finance_smoke.php), [marketplace_price_smoke.php](../../tests/Integration/marketplace_price_smoke.php) | [PilotReadOnlyTest.php](../../laravel-foundation/tests/Feature/PilotReadOnlyTest.php) | Pilot dashboard fixture reconciliation passes; broader finance/HPP and order-detail runtime parity remains open |
| Documents/private storage | [marketplace_shipping_documents_smoke.php](../../tests/Integration/marketplace_shipping_documents_smoke.php), [konveksi_integrity_test.php](../../tests/Integration/konveksi_integrity_test.php) | No complete Laravel document pilot | Storage permissions and restore require staging rehearsal |
| Build/release | [shared-hosting-release.md](../../laravel-foundation/docs/shared-hosting-release.md) and upload manifest | Build artifact checks | Release artifact exists; production host setup/cutover not performed |

## 9. Static findings and migration order

1. The legacy boundary is broad: one RPC endpoint and one Marketplace AJAX
   endpoint dispatch many business operations. They must be split by vertical
   slice, not replaced by one generic Laravel controller.
2. Several legacy endpoints are intentionally unavailable or provider-pending:
   `save_api_credentials`, `update_stock_allocation`,
   `run_safety_buffer_sync`, `trigger_cron_worker`, and `marketplace-webhook`.
   They must not be reported as migrated functionality.
3. The active Marketplace frontend has duplicate JavaScript trees. The caller
   path must be part of each contract test so the wrong copy is not silently
   validated.
4. The largest cross-cutting contracts are session/workspace/company/store
   scope, CSRF, HPP effective dates, nominal precision, OAuth callback/state,
   private files, and queue idempotency.
5. Static analysis cannot prove live database permissions, table existence,
   restore, provider rate limits, cron overlap, or response time. Those remain
   explicit staging tasks and are not silently marked PASS.

Recommended execution order after this inventory:

1. Choose one read-only Marketplace dashboard/order slice and run the legacy
   and Laravel versions against the same isolated fixture.
2. Choose one local expense mutation and settle idempotency namespace and
   unique-constraint ownership before accepting more writes.
3. Rehearse one queue process with commit/dispatch failure, timeout restart,
   and cron overlap on an isolated database.
4. Review the resulting diff/branch with the Prompt 10 checklist before any
   merge or cutover.

## 10. Explicit limits of this inventory

- No live database permission inspection was performed.
- No production or shared-hosting worker was started.
- No provider Live request was sent.
- No migration, seed, repair, reset, deletion, or restore was executed.
- The read-only parity run does not create MySQL state; the Marketplace
  dashboard regression was separately run against a random temporary database
  and cleaned up in `finally`.
- Full-system query-count and UI screenshot parity still require a broader
  controlled fixture and staging measurement; the Marketplace/Konveksi pilot
  now has same-fixture response-time and Inertia-props evidence.
